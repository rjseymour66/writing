## Methods and tips

### Paramedic method

The paramedic method is an editing tool for conciseness and active voice.

1. Circle the prepositions
2. Draw a box around the "is" verb forms
3. Ask "Where is the action?"
4. Change the "action" into a simple verb
5. Move the doer into the subject
6. Eliminate "slow wind-ups"
7. Eliminate any redundancies

### Avoid expletives at the beginning of sentences

An expletive is an "it + be" or "there + be" phrase.

*Example*
**Bad**: There is a Yankees game tonight.
**Good**: The Yankees play tonight.

### Avoid overusing noun forms of verbs

A *nominalization* is a noun that is created from an adjective or verb. For example, *decision* from *decide*, *collection* from *collect*.

### Avoid unnecessary infinitive phrases

Try to convert infinitive phrases to finite or brief noun phrases. This often results in replacing *be* verbs with an action verb.

*Example*
**Bad**: The job of the baseball clean-up hitter is to hit home runs.
**Good**: The clean-up hitter hits home runs.
