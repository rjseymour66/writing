## Parts of Speech

### Nouns
Person, place, or thing.
*count noun*: A noun that can be counted, such as 'shirt' or 'dog'
*noncount noun*: A noun that cannot be counted, such as 'style' or 'integrity'

### Pronouns
A word that takes the place of a noun in a sentence.

*Relative pronouns* introduce relative clauses, which is a dependent clause. Examples include:
- who/whom
- whoever/whomever
- whose
- that
- which

### Articles
*Articles* precede a noun or a noun phrase. The following are examples of articles:
- a
- an
- the

### Adjectives
A word that modifies or describes a noun or pronoun. Adjs precede nouns, but may appear after a form of the reflexive verb "to be".

### Verbs
Denotes action, or state of being.  
A *verbal* is a verb that acts like a noun. See Gerunds, Particples, and Infinitives.  

An *irregular* verb is 

A *two-part* or *phrasal verb* is a verb followed by an adverb or a preposition. 

**Verbs with helpers** 

### Adverbs
Modifies or further describes a verb. Commonly end in *-ly*. 

### Conjunctions

### Prepositions
Work with a noun or pronoun to create phrases that modify verbs, nouns/pronouns, or adjectives. A *prepositional phrase* conveys a spatial, temporal, or directional meaning.

### Verbs that act like nouns: Gerunds, Participles, and Infinitives

## Clauses
### Relative clause
Relative clauses modify a word, phrase, or idea in the main clause.

## Methods and tips

### Paramedic method

The paramedic method is an editing tool for conciseness and active voice.

1. Circle the prepositions
2. Draw a box around the "is" verb forms
3. Ask "Where is the action?"
4. Change the "action" into a simple verb
5. Move the doer into the subject
6. Eliminate "slow wind-ups"
7. Eliminate any redundancies

### Avoid expletives at the beginning of sentences

An expletive is an "it + be" or "there + be" phrase.

*Example*
**Bad**: There is a Yankees game tonight.
**Good**: The Yankees play tonight.

### Avoid overusing noun forms of verbs

A *nominalization* is a noun that is created from an adjective or verb. For example, *decision* from *decide*, *collection* from *collect*.

### Avoid unnecessary infinitive phrases

Try to convert infinitive phrases to finite or brief noun phrases. This often results in replacing *be* verbs with an action verb.

*Example*
**Bad**: The job of the baseball clean-up hitter is to hit home runs.
**Good**: The clean-up hitter hits home runs.

# Sentence Structure

## Clauses
A _restrictive clause_ modifies the noun or noun phrase of the sentence in an essential way.

For restrictive clauses, use the relative pronoun _that_, not which.

**Example**: The dog _that got hit by a car_ was just a puppy.

### Who vs whom

Use 'whom' as the object of a verb or preposition.

**Example**: 

# Sentence Revision

## Diagnose, Analyze, and Revise

1. Diagnose.
  a. Ignoring intro phrases, underline the first 8 or so words in the sentence.
  b. Check for abstract nouns, and see if you have underlined a verb.
2. Analyze.
  a. Who are the main characters? Look for real characters, not abstract.
  b. What actions are the main characters doing? Check for nominalizations.
3. Revise.
  a. Turn the nominalizations into verbs.
  b. Make the characters the subjects of the sentence.
  c. Rewrite using conjunctions: _because, if, when, although, why, how, whether_ or _that_.

**Example**: The health care industry's inability to exert cost controls could lead to the public's decision that congressional action is needed.
1. (The health care industry's inability to exert cost)
  - abstract nouns: none
  - verb: to exert
2. main characters: health care industry, public, congress
   actions: exert, decide, act
3. If the health care industry cannot exert cost controls, the public might decide that congress must act. 

### Common patterns

1. The nominalization is the subject of an empty verb.
An _empty verb_ replaces other verbs. Examples include _have, give, take, make, do,_ and _get_.

**Example**: The decision of the group is to leave at 9pm.
  a. Change the nominalization into a verb:
     decide
  b. Find the character that is the subject of the verb.
     The group
  c. Make the character the subject of the verb.
     The group decided to leave at 9pm.

2. _There is_ or _There are_ followed by a nominalization.
**Example**: There are decisions that need to be made.
  a. Change the nominalization into a verb:
     decide
  b. Find the character that is the subject of the verb.
     We 
  c. Make the character the subject of the verb.
     We need to decide.

3. One nominalization is a subject, and another appears after an empty like _be, seems, has_...
**Example**: Our failure in the last inning was due to their exploitation of our bullpen.
  a. Change the nominalization into a verb:
     failure -> fail, exploitation -> exploit
  b. Find the character that is the subject of the verb.
     our, their
  c. Make the character the subject of the verb.
     We fail, they exploit
  d. Link the new clauses with a logical expression
     simple clauses: _because, since, when_
     conditional clauses: _if, provided that, so long as_
     contradictions: _though, although, unless_

     Our failure ......................... We failed
                                           in the last inning
     was due to their..................... because
     their exploitation of our bullpen ... they exploited our bullpen.
