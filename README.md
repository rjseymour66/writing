**Verbs with helpers** 

### Adverbs
Modifies or further describes a verb. Commonly end in *-ly*. 

### Conjunctions

### Prepositions
Work with a noun or pronoun to create phrases that modify verbs, nouns/pronouns, or adjectives. A *prepositional phrase* conveys a spatial, temporal, or directional meaning.

### Verbs that act like nouns: Gerunds, Participles, and Infinitives


### Phrases

A phrase is a group of words that function as a grammatical unit. The grammatical unit is defined by its _head word_, or the word that begins the phrase.

The following table describes the different kinds of phrases:

| Type | Description | Example | 
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Prepositional | Introduced by a preposition. It functions as an adjective ('which one'?) or an adverb ('how, when, where'?). The subject cannot be in a prepositional phrase. | The bird landed _on my windowsill_. |
| Noun          | A noun and its modifiers.<br>Modifiers that come before the noun include: articles, possessive nouns/pronouns, adjectives, and participles.<br>Modifiers that come after include: prepositional phrases, adjective clauses, participle phrases, infinitives | Jack found the dog that has three legs. |
| Infinitive    | Infinitive form of a verb that can begin a sentence.       | To keep the sweat out of my eyes, I wear a cap when I run. |
| Participle    | The participle form of a verb.   | The guitar player sitting down did not play well last night. |
| Appositive    | Renames the term just mentioned  | Dr. Sprouse, the professor with the most tenure, is retiring this year. |

## Clauses
### Relative clause
Relative clauses modify a word, phrase, or idea in the main clause.





# Sentence Structure*

## Modifiers

Modifiers include adjectives, adverbs, and modifying phrases. You must make clear what a modifier 'modifies'. A few tips:
- Noun modifiers are generally placed before the noun. For example, "I drive a _gray_ car."
- Adverbs usually follow the verbs or adverbs that they modify. For example, "The woman swam _quickly_ to the shore."
- Be careful with **only** and **both**. 

## Active sentence structure

Active sentences use the subject-verb-object (S-V-O) or subject-verb-complement (S-V-C) structure. The complement either restates or describes the subject. Instransitive verbs do not have a complement, but they can preced adverbs or adverbial phrases.

The following table describes the components of the sentence predicate for each verb type:

| Verb type    | Complement         | Description                                                     |
|:-------------|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| transitive   | direct object      | The DO answers 'what' or 'who'?                                 | 
|              | object complement  | The OC describes or identifies the DO                           |
| linking      | subject complement | The SC describes or restates the subject                        |
| intransitive |                    | Takes no complement, but can take an adverb or adverbial phrase |

## Modifiers

A _modifier_ is an adjective, adverb, or phrase that adds to the meaning of a noun, verb, or complement. A modifier limits the features that the modified element can have, a property that is somewhat similar to a restrictive clause.

## Clauses

A clause has a subject and a verb.

### Independent clause (main clause)
In a complex sentence, the independent clause conveys the main idea of the sentence and can stand alone as its own sentence.

### Dependent clause (subordinate clause)
In a complex sentence, a dependent clause provides supporting information to the independent clause. It cannot stand as its own sentence.

The subordinate clause begins with either a [subordinate conjunction](https://chompchomp.com/terms/subordinateconjunction.htm) or a relative pronoun. A relative pronoun (_who, whom, whose, which, that_) introduce adjective clauses.


### Restrictive clause
A _restrictive clause_ modifies the noun or noun phrase of the sentence in an essential way. It creates a subclass of the noun or noun phrase that it modifies.

For restrictive clauses, use the relative pronoun _that_ without a comma.

**Example**: The dog _that has the spot on his head_ is a puppy.

### Who vs whom

Use 'whom' as the object of a verb or preposition.

**Example**: 

# Sentence Revision

## Methods and tips

## Diagnose, Analyze, and Revise

1. Diagnose.  
   a. Ignoring intro phrases, underline the first 8 or so words in the sentence.  
   b. Check for abstract nouns, and see if you have underlined a verb.  
2. Analyze.  
   a. Who are the main characters? Look for real characters, not abstract.  
   b. What actions are the main characters doing? Check for nominalizations.
3. Revise.  
   a. Turn the nominalizations into verbs.  
   b. Make the characters the subjects of the sentence.  
   c. Rewrite using conjunctions: _because, if, when, although, why, how, whether_ or _that_.  

**Example**: The health care industry's inability to exert cost controls could lead to the public's decision that congressional action is needed.
1. (The health care industry's inability to exert cost)
  - abstract nouns: none
  - verb: to exert
2. main characters: health care industry, public, congress
   actions: exert, decide, act
3. If the health care industry cannot exert cost controls, the public might decide that congress must act. 

### Common patterns

1. The nominalization is the subject of an empty verb.
An _empty verb_ replaces other verbs. Examples include _have, give, take, make, do,_ and _get_.
   ```
   The decision of the group is to leave at 9pm.
   ```
   a. Change the nominalization into a verb:
     `decide`
   b. Find the character that is the subject of the verb.
     `The group`
   c. Make the character the subject of the verb.
     `The group decided to leave at 9pm.`

2. _There is_ or _There are_ followed by a nominalization.
   ```
   There are decisions that need to be made.
   ```
   a. Change the nominalization into a verb:
     `decide`
   b. Find the character that is the subject of the verb.
     `We` 
   c. Make the character the subject of the verb.
     `We need to decide.`

3. One nominalization is a subject, and another appears after an empty like _be, seems, has_...
   ```
   Our failure in the last inning was due to their exploitation of our bullpen.
   ```
   a. Change the nominalization into a verb:
     `failure` -> `fail`, `exploitation` -> `exploit`
   b. Find the character that is the subject of the verb.
     `our`, `their`
   c. Make the character the subject of the verb.
     `We fail`, `they exploit`
   d. Link the new clauses with a logical expression
     **simple clauses**: _because, since, when_
     **conditional clauses**: _if, provided that, so long as_
     **contradictions**: _though, although, unless_
     ```
     Our failure ......................... We failed
                                           in the last inning
     was due to their..................... because
     their exploitation of our bullpen ... they exploited our bullpen.
     ```

### Paramedic method

The paramedic method is an editing tool for conciseness and active voice.

1. Circle the prepositions
2. Draw a box around the "is" verb forms
3. Ask "Where is the action?"
4. Change the "action" into a simple verb
5. Move the doer into the subject
6. Eliminate "slow wind-ups"
7. Eliminate any redundancies

### Avoid expletives at the beginning of sentences

An expletive is an "it + be" or "there + be" phrase.

*Example*
**Bad**: There is a Yankees game tonight.
**Good**: The Yankees play tonight.

### Avoid overusing noun forms of verbs

A *nominalization* is a noun that is created from an adjective or verb. For example, *decision* from *decide*, *collection* from *collect*.

### Avoid unnecessary infinitive phrases

Try to convert infinitive phrases to finite or brief noun phrases. This often results in replacing *be* verbs with an action verb.

*Example*
**Bad**: The job of the baseball clean-up hitter is to hit home runs.
**Good**: The clean-up hitter hits home runs.

## Paragraphs

### There is There are sentences

Use these sentences to introduce lists. Otherwise, revise them.

### Known-to-New

Place information that is familiar to the reader at the beginning of the sentence, and end the sentence with new information. This does a few things:
- It employs _end focus_. This places the important information at the end of the sentence for emphasis.
- It provides a linking mechanism to reference the new information from the previous sentence.
  **Example**: The toUpperCase() function transforms characters into uppercase letters. Uppercase characters add the emphasis required for important admonitions.
